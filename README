This simple python script takes a Latitude JSON File which you can get via Google Takeout (https://www.google.com/takeout/?pli=1#custom:latitude) and converts it into other formats.

Usage:
latitude_json_converter.py input output [-h] [-f {kml,json,csv,js,gpx,gpxtracks}] [-v]

input                Input File (JSON)
output               Output File (will be overwritten without prompt!)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                                    Show this help message and exit
  -f, --format {kml,json,csv,js,gpx,gpxtracks}  Format of the output
  -v, --variable                                Variable name for js export


Available formats:

kml (default):
KML file with placemarks for each location in your Latitude History. Each placemark will have a point location and a timestamp

csv:
Comma-separated textfile with a TimeStamp and a Location field, suitable for upload to Fusion Tables

json:
Smaller JSON File with only the TimeStamp and the Location

js:
JavaScript File which sets a variable in global namespace (default: window.latitudeJsonData) to the full data object for easy access in local scripts. Just include the js file before your actual script.

gpx:
GPS Exchange Format including location, timestamp, and accuracy/speed/altitude as available.  Data produced is valid GPX 1.1.  Points are stored as individual, unrelated waypoints (like the other formats, except for gpxtracks).

gpxtracks:
GPS Exchange Format including location, timestamp, and accuracy/speed/altitude as available.  Data produced is valid GPX 1.1.  Points are grouped together into tracks by time and location (specifically, two chronological points split a track if they differ by over 10 minutes or approximately 40 kilometers).
