This simple Python script takes a Latitude JSON file which you can get via Google Takeout (https://www.google.com/takeout/?pli=1#custom:latitude) and converts it into other formats.

Usage:
latitude_json_converter.py input output [-h] [-f {kml,json,csv}]

input                Input File (JSON)
output               Output File (will be overwritten without prompt!)

optional arguments:
  -h, --help                      Show this help message and exit
  -f, --format {kml,json,csv,js}  Format of the output
  -v, --variable                  Variable name for js export


Available formats:

kml (default):
KML file with placemarks for each location in your Latitude History.  Each placemark will have a location, a timestamp, and accuracy/speed/altitude as available.  Data produced is valid KML 2.2.

csv:
Comma-separated text file with a timestamp field and a location field, suitable for upload to Fusion Tables.

json:
Smaller JSON file with only the timestamp and the location.

js:
JavaScript file which sets a variable in global namespace (default: window.latitudeJsonData) to the full data object for easy access in local scripts.  Just include the js file before your actual script.  Only timestamp and location are included.
